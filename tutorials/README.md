# Tutorials

In this folder you can find a collection of useful tutorials in order to understand the principles and the potential of **EZyRB**.

#### [Tutorial 1 - Offline phase](tutorial-1-offline-phase.ipynb)
Here we show the typical workflow for the construcion of the reduced basis space, called offline phase. The model reduction is done on a vtk pressure field.

#### [Tutorial 2 - Online phase](tutorial-2-online-phase.ipynb)
In this tutorial we show the workflow for the online evaluation of the output of interest. It is the natural continuation of the first tutorial on the vtk pressure field.

#### [Tutorial 3 - Output interpolation](tutorial-3-interpolation.ipynb)
Here we show how use the module mapper in order to interpolate the solutions (computed on meshes with different dimensions) on a new fixed dimension mesh.


#### More to come...
We plan to add more tutorials but the time is often against us. If you want to contribute with a notebook on a feature not covered yet we will be very happy and give you support on editing!
